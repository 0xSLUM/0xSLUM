> I'm a long time **programmer** that currently  **designs** and **builds** software for the Automotive and Finance industries. When I'm not doing that, I'm usually spending my time doing security research *(poorly)*, unintentionally breaking things or tinkering with embedded systems. Outside of tech, I enjoy woodworking, cars and my cats.
